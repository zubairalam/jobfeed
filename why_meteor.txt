Meteor is chosen ONLY for fast prototyping.
To do more in less time just by one developer.
Once a prototype is built and approved by its users, if required can be moved to Python/Django/SQL.

Why not continuing with Meteor after trying it again for 1 day + 1 night + half day.
1. Setting a custom UI for login, logout, register, forgot password is non trivial.
2. We need to read through many packages source code to make changes in ui customization the way we want
3. This knowledge is difficult to transfer to somebody else. and not easier to convince them to study this much of libraries and guides.
4. We know that we need to do redo the whole application again.
5. More time is spent to find a hack to solve an issue.
6. Community has shrunken. Big contributors have moved to non Meteor solutions.
7. Its advertised in a way that shows it can do prototyping very quickly. But I found its not that quick. Rather slower than what I can do in Django.
